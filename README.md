# CountingCubes

This is an iOS application designed for seniors to exercise their brains and prevent dementia. Users enter any level, count the correct number of cubes in the model, and answer it. Please note, this app needs to be used on an iPhone or iPad with iOS 16.0 or iPadOS 16.0 or above.

## Prerequisites

- An iPhone or iPad device with iOS 16.0 or iPadOS 16.0 and above.
- If the user wants to use the AR function, they need to grant the app camera permissions.

## Installation

1.Download the repository to your local machine.
2.Open the project in Xcode.
3.Run the project on a supported physical device.

## Usage

Start the application, choose a level you like, then start counting cubes and answering the correct number. You can use the AR mode to view and count these cubes in the real world.

## Development

We built the user interface using SwiftUI and created cube models using the Reality Composer tool built into Xcode. We use AR Quick Look to preview these models and ARKit to allow users to view these 3D models in the real environment.
